  "description": "Join us in this peaceful episode of the St. Helena Ministries Daily Rosary as we meditate on the Sorrowful Mysteries, inviting you to enter more deeply into the passion of Christ through prayerful reflection. This episode offers a quiet space to contemplate the profound love and sacrifice revealed in the Gospel, as found in the accounts of the Passion in the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. We gently guide you through each mystery with reverence and calm, fostering a spirit of devotion and trust.\n\nIf this prayerful time blesses your heart, please consider supporting this ministry to help us continue offering these daily moments of grace. Your generosity sustains our mission to bring the Rosary and other sacred prayers to listeners worldwide.\n\nFor those seeking to enrich their daily prayer life further, we invite you to explore our Divine Office podcast, where the Liturgy of the Hours is prayed with the same reverence and care.\n\nMay this time of prayer bring you peace and closeness to Our Lord.",
