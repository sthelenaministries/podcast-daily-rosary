  "description": "In this episode of the St. Helena Ministries – Daily Rosary, we prayerfully meditate on the Sorrowful Mysteries, inviting you to enter more deeply into the Passion of Our Lord. Through these sacred reflections, we accompany Jesus in His suffering and love, drawing strength and grace from His example. This daily prayer offers a moment of calm and spiritual nourishment amid the busyness of life. If you find this ministry a source of peace and inspiration, please consider supporting our work to help us continue sharing these prayers. We also invite you to explore our Divine Office podcast, where the Church’s daily prayers unfold in a beautiful rhythm of Scripture and psalmody. Visit our website to learn more and join our growing community of prayer. May this time of prayer bring you closer to the heart of Christ and deepen your faith today.",
