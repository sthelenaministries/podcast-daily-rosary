  "description": "In this episode of the St. Helena Ministries – Daily Rosary, we prayerfully meditate on the Sorrowful Mysteries, inviting you to enter more deeply into the Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ. As we reflect on these sacred moments, drawn from the Gospels, we unite our hearts with Mary’s sorrow and Christ’s loving sacrifice. This daily prayer offers a serene space to grow in faith and trust through contemplative prayer. If this ministry blesses your prayer life, please consider supporting us so we can continue to provide these spiritual resources freely. We also invite you to explore our Divine Office podcast, where the Church’s daily prayers are prayed in the rhythm of the liturgical hours, enriching your journey in the Word of God (Psalm, Psalms; Revelation, chapters 4–5). Visit our website to learn more. May this time of prayer bring you peace and closeness to Christ’s heart.",
