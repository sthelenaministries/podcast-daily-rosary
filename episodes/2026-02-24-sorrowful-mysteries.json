  "description": "In this episode of the St. Helena Ministries – Daily Rosary, we prayerfully meditate on the Sorrowful Mysteries, inviting you to enter more deeply into the Passion of our Lord as revealed in the Gospel accounts (Matthew 26–27, Mark 14–15, Luke 22–23, John 18–19). Through these sacred prayers, we accompany Jesus in His suffering and embrace the grace found in His sacrifice. We encourage you to join us in this quiet time of reflection and devotion.\n\nIf you find this ministry a blessing in your spiritual journey, please consider supporting our work to help us continue offering these daily prayers freely to all. Your generosity sustains this mission and allows us to reach more souls seeking peace in Christ.\n\nFor those interested in expanding their daily prayer life, we invite you to explore our Divine Office podcast, where the Church’s Liturgy of the Hours is prayed throughout the day, enriching your connection to the universal Church.\n\nMay this time of prayer bring you consolation and deepen your faith in the loving presence of Christ.",
