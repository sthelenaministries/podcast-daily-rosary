  "description": "In this episode of the St. Helena Ministries Daily Rosary, we pray the Sorrowful Mysteries, inviting you to enter deeply into the passion of Christ through contemplative prayer. Each mystery is meditated upon with reverence and quiet reflection, drawing from the Gospel accounts in the books of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. This prayerful time offers a peaceful space to unite your intentions with the sufferings of Our Lord.\n\nIf you find this ministry a source of spiritual nourishment, please consider supporting our work to help us continue providing daily prayers and reflections. Your generosity enables us to share these moments of grace with a wider community.\n\nFor those seeking to enrich their daily prayer life further, we invite you to explore our Divine Office podcast, where the Church’s official prayers are prayed throughout the day in union with the universal Church.\n\nMay this time of prayer bring you closer to the heart of Christ and deepen your trust in His mercy.",
