  "description": "In this episode of the St. Helena Ministries – Daily Rosary, we prayerfully meditate on the Sorrowful Mysteries, inviting you to enter more deeply into the passion and sacrifice of Our Lord. Through each mystery, we reflect on the profound love and mercy revealed in these moments of Christ’s suffering, drawing strength and grace from this sacred devotion. We warmly invite you to support this ministry, helping us to continue offering these daily prayers freely to all who seek spiritual nourishment. For those wishing to enrich their prayer life further, consider exploring our Divine Office podcast, which guides listeners through the Church’s daily liturgical prayers. Thank you for joining us in this peaceful time of contemplation and prayer. May God’s peace be with you always.",
