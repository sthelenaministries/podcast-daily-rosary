In this episode of the St. Helena Ministries – Daily Rosary, we gather to pray the Glorious Mysteries, reflecting on the Resurrection, Ascension, the coming of the Holy Spirit, the Assumption of Mary, and her Coronation as Queen of Heaven. This sacred prayer invites us to meditate on the triumph of Christ and the hope of eternal life, drawing us closer to the heart of the Gospel as revealed in the Scriptures, including passages from the Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles. We warmly invite you to join in this peaceful moment of prayer and contemplation.

If you find spiritual nourishment in these prayers, please consider supporting this ministry to help us continue sharing the Rosary and other Catholic devotions with listeners around the world. Your generosity sustains our mission and allows us to offer these resources freely.

For those seeking to deepen their daily prayer life, we also encourage you to explore our Divine Office podcast, where the Liturgy of the Hours is prayed in union with the universal Church.

May this time of prayer bring you peace and grace throughout your day.
