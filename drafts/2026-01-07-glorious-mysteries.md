In this episode of St. Helena Ministries – Daily Rosary, we prayerfully meditate on the Glorious Mysteries, inviting you to enter into the joyful contemplation of Christ’s Resurrection, Ascension, the descent of the Holy Spirit, the Assumption of Mary, and her Coronation as Queen of Heaven. Each mystery is reflected upon with reverence, drawing from the Gospel accounts and the sacred tradition to deepen your daily prayer experience. We encourage you to join us in this peaceful moment of devotion, allowing the mysteries to inspire faith and hope in your heart.

If you find this ministry a blessing in your spiritual journey, please consider supporting our work so that we may continue to offer these prayers freely to all who seek them. Your generosity helps sustain our mission of prayer and evangelization.

For those wishing to enrich their daily prayer life further, we invite you to explore our Divine Office podcast, where the Church’s Liturgy of the Hours is prayed with reverence and care.

May this time of prayer bring you closer to the peace and grace of our Lord and His Blessed Mother.
