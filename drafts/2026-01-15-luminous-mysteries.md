In this episode of St. Helena Ministries – Daily Rosary, we prayerfully meditate on the Luminous Mysteries, reflecting on the public ministry of Our Lord Jesus Christ as revealed in the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Join us in this sacred time of contemplation and devotion, inviting the Holy Spirit to deepen your faith and understanding through each mystery. As you pray along, may your heart be drawn closer to the life and mission of Christ.

If this ministry nourishes your spiritual journey, please consider supporting us so we may continue to provide these daily prayers freely to all who seek them. Your generosity helps sustain our work in spreading the beauty of Catholic prayer.

For those wishing to enrich their daily prayer life further, we also invite you to explore our Divine Office podcast, where the Church’s official prayers are prayed throughout the day in communion with the universal Church.

May the peace of Christ be with you as you enter into this time of prayer.
