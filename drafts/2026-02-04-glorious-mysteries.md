In this episode of St. Helena Ministries – Daily Rosary, we prayerfully meditate on the Glorious Mysteries, inviting you to join in reflecting on the Resurrection, Ascension, and the coming of the Holy Spirit, among other sacred events. This daily prayer offers a moment of calm and reverence, drawing us closer to the heart of Christ through the intercession of Our Lady. As you listen, may you find peace and spiritual nourishment in this contemplative time.

If you feel moved to support this ministry’s ongoing work in spreading the beauty of Catholic prayer, please consider a gentle contribution. Your generosity helps sustain these daily reflections and reach more souls seeking quiet prayer.

For those wishing to deepen their daily devotion, we also invite you to explore our Divine Office podcast, where the Church’s Liturgy of the Hours is prayed throughout the day, enriching your spiritual journey with the Psalms and Scripture readings.

May this time of prayer bring you grace and serenity.
