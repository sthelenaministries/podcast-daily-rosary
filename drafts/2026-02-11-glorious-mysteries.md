In this episode of the St. Helena Ministries – Daily Rosary, we gather to pray the Glorious Mysteries, inviting you to meditate on the Resurrection, Ascension, Descent of the Holy Spirit, the Assumption of Mary, and the Coronation of Our Lady. Through these sacred reflections, we seek to deepen our communion with Christ and His Mother, following the rhythm of daily Catholic prayer. The scriptural foundations for these mysteries can be found in the Gospels and Acts. We encourage you to join us in this peaceful devotion, fostering a spirit of reverence and trust in God’s providence. If this ministry enriches your prayer life, please consider supporting our work to help us continue offering these prayers freely. For those who desire to extend their daily prayer, we invite you to explore our Divine Office podcast, which complements the Rosary by praying the Liturgy of the Hours throughout the day. Visit our website to learn more and to support this ministry. May this time of prayer bring you grace and serenity.
