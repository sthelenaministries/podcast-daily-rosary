In this episode of the St. Helena Ministries Daily Rosary, we gather to pray the Glorious Mysteries, reflecting on the Resurrection, Ascension, the coming of the Holy Spirit, the Assumption of Mary, and her Coronation as Queen of Heaven. This prayerful meditation invites you to enter more deeply into the Paschal mystery and the hope of eternal life, guided by the sacred rhythms of Scripture and tradition. Join us in this calm and reverent moment of daily Catholic prayer, fostering a spirit of peace and contemplation.

If this ministry nourishes your prayer life, please consider supporting our work to help us continue offering these daily prayers freely to all. Your generosity sustains this mission and is deeply appreciated.

For those seeking to enrich their daily prayer routine further, we invite you to explore our Divine Office podcast, where the Church’s Liturgy of the Hours is prayed throughout the day, uniting the faithful in continual praise.

May this time of prayer bring you closer to the heart of Christ and the peace of His resurrection.
