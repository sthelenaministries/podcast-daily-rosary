In this episode of the St. Helena Ministries – Daily Rosary podcast, we prayerfully meditate on the Luminous Mysteries, reflecting on the public ministry of Jesus Christ as revealed in the Gospel of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Join us in this sacred time of contemplation and devotion, deepening your connection with the life of our Lord through the gentle rhythm of the Rosary. As you listen, may your heart be drawn closer to the light of Christ’s presence in the world.

If this ministry blesses you, please consider supporting our work so we can continue to offer these daily prayers freely to all who seek them. Your generosity sustains our mission and helps spread the beauty of Catholic prayer.

For those interested in enriching their daily prayer life further, we invite you to explore our Divine Office podcast, where the Church’s official prayers throughout the day are prayed and reflected upon with reverence and care.

May the peace of Christ be with you always as you journey in prayer.
