In this episode of the St. Helena Ministries Daily Rosary, we prayerfully meditate on the Luminous Mysteries, inviting you to reflect on the public ministry of Our Lord as revealed in the Gospel of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Join us in this sacred time of prayer, contemplating the profound moments that illuminate Christ’s mission and presence in the world. As you pray along, may your heart be drawn closer to the mysteries of faith and the loving guidance of Our Blessed Mother.

If you find this ministry a source of spiritual nourishment, please consider supporting our work so we may continue to offer these daily prayers freely to all who seek them. Your generosity helps sustain this humble mission.

For those wishing to deepen their daily prayer life, we also invite you to listen to our Divine Office podcast, where the Church’s official prayers are prayed throughout the day, fostering a rhythm of prayer and praise.

May this time of prayer bring you peace and grace.
