In this episode of St. Helena Ministries – Daily Rosary, we gather to pray the Joyful Mysteries, reflecting on the early life of our Lord and the profound moments of grace in the Annunciation, Visitation, Nativity, Presentation, and Finding in the Temple. With a spirit of quiet devotion, we invite you to join in this sacred prayer, opening your heart to the gentle presence of Christ through the intercession of Our Blessed Mother. As you pray with us, may you find peace and renewal in these mysteries.

If this ministry enriches your prayer life, please consider supporting our work to help us continue offering these daily prayers freely. Your generosity sustains our mission and allows us to reach more souls seeking the comfort of the Rosary.

For those who desire to deepen their daily prayer rhythm, we also encourage you to explore our Divine Office podcast, where the Church’s Liturgy of the Hours is prayed with reverence and care.

Thank you for joining us in prayer today; may the peace of Christ remain with you always.
