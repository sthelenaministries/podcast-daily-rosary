In this episode of the St. Helena Ministries – Daily Rosary, we come together in prayer to meditate on the Sorrowful Mysteries, reflecting on the profound moments of Christ’s Passion as presented in the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Each mystery invites us to enter more deeply into the love and sacrifice of our Lord, fostering a spirit of quiet contemplation and trust in God’s mercy. Join us in this sacred prayer, offering your intentions and seeking spiritual renewal through the Rosary.

If this ministry enriches your prayer life, please consider supporting our ongoing efforts to provide daily Catholic prayer resources. Your generosity helps us continue to share these moments of grace with others.

For those who wish to deepen their daily prayer routine, we invite you to explore our Divine Office podcast, where the Church’s Liturgy of the Hours is prayed and reflected upon with reverence and care.

May this time of prayer bring you peace and draw you closer to the heart of Christ.
