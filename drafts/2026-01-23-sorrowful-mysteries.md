In this episode of St. Helena Ministries – Daily Rosary, we prayerfully meditate on the Sorrowful Mysteries, inviting you to enter more deeply into the Passion of our Lord through contemplative prayer. Each mystery is thoughtfully presented to guide your reflection on the profound love and sacrifice revealed in the Gospel according to the accounts found in the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. This daily prayer offers a peaceful moment to unite your heart with Mary and Jesus in the journey of redemption.

If this ministry blesses your prayer life, please consider supporting our work with a gift. Your generosity helps us continue to provide these daily prayers freely to all who seek them. Visit our website to learn more about how you can contribute.

For those who desire to enrich their daily prayer routine further, we invite you to explore our Divine Office podcast, where the Church’s official prayer is prayed throughout the day, deepening your communion with the liturgical rhythm of the Church.

May this time of prayer bring you peace and spiritual refreshment.
