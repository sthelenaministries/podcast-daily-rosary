In this episode of St. Helena Ministries – Daily Rosary, we gather in prayer to meditate on the Luminous Mysteries, reflecting on the public ministry of Our Lord as revealed in the Gospel of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Join us in this sacred time of contemplation, as we seek to deepen our faith and draw closer to Christ through the gentle rhythm of the Rosary. We invite you to support this ministry, helping us to continue offering these daily prayers freely to all who wish to join. For those who desire to enrich their daily prayer life further, we also encourage you to explore our Divine Office podcast, where the Church’s Liturgy of the Hours is prayed with reverence and care. Visit our website to learn more and to offer your support. May this time of prayer bring peace to your heart and a quiet strength to your day.
