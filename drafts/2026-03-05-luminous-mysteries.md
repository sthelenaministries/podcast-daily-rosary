In this episode of St. Helena Ministries – Daily Rosary, we prayerfully meditate on the Luminous Mysteries, reflecting on the public ministry of Jesus Christ as revealed in the Gospel of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Join us in this sacred time of prayer, inviting the Holy Spirit to deepen your understanding and devotion through each mystery. As we contemplate these mysteries, we unite our hearts with the Church’s daily prayer, seeking grace and peace.

If this ministry blesses your prayer life, please consider supporting our mission to share the beauty of Catholic prayer with others. Your generosity helps us continue to provide these daily reflections freely.

For those who wish to enrich their prayer routine further, we invite you to explore our Divine Office podcast, where the Church’s official daily prayers are prayed in communion with the universal Church.

May this time of prayer bring you closer to Christ’s light and peace.
