In this episode of St. Helena Ministries – Daily Rosary, we pray the Joyful Mysteries, inviting you to meditate on the joyful events in the life of Our Lord and Our Lady. Through this sacred prayer, we reflect on moments such as the Annunciation and the Nativity, drawing closer to the heart of the Gospel as revealed in the Scriptures. Join us in this peaceful time of prayer and contemplation, fostering a deeper connection with God’s love and grace.

If you find this ministry a source of spiritual nourishment, please consider supporting our work so we may continue to offer these daily prayers freely to all who seek them. Your generosity helps sustain our mission of prayer and formation.

For those wishing to expand their daily prayer life, we also invite you to listen to our Divine Office podcast, which offers the Church’s official daily prayers, enriching your journey in faith throughout the day.

May this time of prayer bring you quiet peace and renewed hope.
