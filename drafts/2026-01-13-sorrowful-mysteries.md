In this episode of the St. Helena Ministries – Daily Rosary, we prayerfully meditate on the Sorrowful Mysteries, inviting you to enter deeply into the passion and sacrifice of Our Lord. Through each decade, we reflect on the profound moments of Christ’s suffering as revealed in the Gospels, drawing close in humble contemplation and trust. This daily prayer offers a serene space to unite your intentions with the heart of Jesus, fostering peace and spiritual renewal.

If you find this ministry a source of grace in your daily prayer life, please consider supporting our work. Your generosity helps us continue to provide these prayers freely to all who seek them. Visit our website to learn more about how you can contribute.

For those wishing to enrich their prayer routine further, we also invite you to explore our Divine Office podcast, where the Church’s daily prayers are prayed in communion with the universal Church.

May this time of prayer bring you consolation and strength in the Lord’s loving presence.
