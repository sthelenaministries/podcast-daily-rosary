In this episode of St. Helena Ministries – Daily Rosary, we prayerfully meditate on the Luminous Mysteries, inviting the faithful to contemplate the public ministry of Jesus Christ. Through each mystery, we reflect on the profound moments revealed in the Gospel, as found in the Scriptures of the Gospels, chapters 3 through 11. This time of prayer offers a serene opportunity to deepen your relationship with Christ and embrace His light in daily life. We warmly encourage you to support this ministry, helping us continue to provide these moments of sacred prayer and reflection. For those seeking to enrich their daily spiritual routine, consider also listening to our Divine Office podcast, which offers the Church’s official prayers throughout the day.
