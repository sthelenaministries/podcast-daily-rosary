In this episode of St. Helena Ministries – Daily Rosary, we prayerfully meditate on the Glorious Mysteries, inviting you to join in reflecting on the Resurrection, Ascension, and the coming of the Holy Spirit, as well as the Assumption and Coronation of Mary. Each mystery is presented with reverence, guiding you through a peaceful and contemplative prayer experience rooted in Scripture from the Gospels and Acts. We encourage you to enter into this sacred time of prayer with calm and devotion.

If you find this ministry a source of spiritual nourishment, please consider supporting our work so we can continue to provide daily prayers and reflections. Your generosity helps sustain this humble mission.

For those seeking to deepen their daily prayer life further, we invite you to explore our Divine Office podcast, where the Church’s Liturgy of the Hours is prayed with the same care and reverence.

May this time of prayer bring you closer to the peace and grace of our Lord.
