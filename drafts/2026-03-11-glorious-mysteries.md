In this episode of the St. Helena Ministries – Daily Rosary, we gather to pray the Glorious Mysteries, inviting peaceful reflection on the Resurrection, Ascension, and the coming of the Holy Spirit, as well as the Assumption and Coronation of Mary. Each mystery is prayed with reverence, drawing us deeper into the life of Christ and the communion of saints, supported by meditations rooted in the Scriptures of the Gospels and Acts. This prayerful time offers a moment of calm and spiritual nourishment in the midst of daily life.

If you find grace in these prayers, please consider supporting this ministry so that we may continue to provide daily opportunities for prayer and contemplation. Your generosity helps sustain this work of faith and devotion.

For those seeking to enrich their daily prayer life further, we invite you to explore our Divine Office podcast, where the Church’s liturgical prayers are prayed throughout the day, fostering a rhythm of sacred time.

May this time of prayer bring you peace and a closer walk with the Lord.
