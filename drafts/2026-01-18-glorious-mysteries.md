In this episode of the St. Helena Ministries – Daily Rosary podcast, we prayerfully meditate on the Glorious Mysteries, inviting you to join us in reflecting on the Resurrection, Ascension, and the gift of the Holy Spirit, as well as the Assumption and Coronation of Mary. Each mystery is presented with reverence and calm, fostering a peaceful environment for contemplative prayer rooted in Scripture from the Gospels and Acts. As you listen, may your heart be drawn closer to the profound joy and hope found in these sacred moments.

If you find spiritual nourishment in these prayers, please consider supporting this ministry to help us continue sharing daily Catholic prayer resources. For those seeking to deepen their daily prayer life further, we invite you to explore our Divine Office podcast, which offers the rich tradition of the Liturgy of the Hours.

Thank you for joining us in this sacred time of prayer; may you be blessed with peace and grace throughout your day.
