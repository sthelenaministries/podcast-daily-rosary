In this episode of St. Helena Ministries – Daily Rosary, we prayerfully meditate on the Luminous Mysteries, reflecting on the public ministry of Our Lord as revealed through the Gospel. Join us in this sacred time of contemplative prayer, inviting the presence of Christ to deepen your faith and devotion. As you listen, may your heart be drawn closer to the light of the mysteries that illuminate the path of discipleship.

If you find this ministry a source of spiritual nourishment, please consider supporting our work. Your generosity helps us continue to offer daily prayer and reflection to the wider community.

For those seeking to enrich their daily prayer life further, we invite you to explore our Divine Office podcast, where the Church’s official prayers are prayed throughout the day in communion with the universal Church.

May this time of prayer bring you peace and grace.
