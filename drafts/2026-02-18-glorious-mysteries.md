In this episode of the St. Helena Ministries Daily Rosary, we pray the Glorious Mysteries, inviting you to meditate on the Resurrection, Ascension, Descent of the Holy Spirit, the Assumption, and the Coronation of Mary. Through these sacred moments, we enter into a peaceful reflection on the triumph of Christ and the hope of eternal life, guided by Scripture references from the Gospels and Acts. We warmly invite you to support this ministry, helping us continue to offer daily prayer resources that nourish the soul and deepen faith. For those seeking to enrich their daily prayer life further, consider exploring our Divine Office podcast, which offers the Church’s official prayer at morning, midday, evening, and night. Visit our website to learn more and join us in these sacred rhythms. May this time of prayer bring you peace and spiritual refreshment.
