In this episode of St. Helena Ministries – Daily Rosary, we prayerfully meditate on the Luminous Mysteries, inviting you to reflect on the public ministry of Jesus Christ as revealed in the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Through these mysteries, we contemplate the Baptism in the Jordan, the Wedding at Cana, the Proclamation of the Kingdom, the Transfiguration, and the Institution of the Eucharist, deepening our union with Christ in a spirit of reverence and peace. We warmly encourage you to support this ministry, helping to sustain these daily moments of prayer and spiritual nourishment. For those seeking to enrich their daily prayer life further, consider also listening to our Divine Office podcast, which offers the Church’s Liturgy of the Hours in a calm and accessible format. Visit our website to learn more or to offer your support. May this time of prayer bring you closer to the heart of Christ and fill your day with grace.
