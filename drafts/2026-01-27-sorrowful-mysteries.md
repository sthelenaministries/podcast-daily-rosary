In this episode of St. Helena Ministries – Daily Rosary, we prayerfully meditate on the Sorrowful Mysteries, inviting the faithful to enter more deeply into the Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ. Each mystery is reflected upon with reverence and calm, fostering a spirit of contemplation and union with Christ’s suffering and love. This daily prayer offers a sacred moment to draw closer to the heart of the Gospel as revealed in the Scriptures, particularly in the accounts found in the Gospels.

If you find this ministry a source of grace in your daily prayer life, we gently invite you to support our work so that we may continue to provide these prayers and reflections freely to all who seek them. Your kindness sustains this mission of prayer and devotion.

For those who desire to enrich their daily prayer rhythm further, we also recommend the Divine Office podcast, which offers the Church’s official prayers throughout the day, complementing the Rosary and deepening your communion with the Church’s liturgical prayer.

May this time of prayer bring you peace and spiritual renewal.
