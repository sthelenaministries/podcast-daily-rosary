In this episode of the St. Helena Ministries – Daily Rosary, we prayerfully meditate on the Sorrowful Mysteries, inviting you to enter more deeply into the passion and sacrifice of our Lord Jesus Christ. Each mystery is presented with reverence and calm reflection, guiding you through this sacred devotion as found in the Holy Scriptures, particularly in the Gospels. As you join in this daily prayer, may your heart be drawn closer to the love and mercy of God.

If this ministry blesses your prayer life, please consider supporting our work so that we may continue to provide these moments of peaceful contemplation. Your generosity helps sustain the mission of bringing the Rosary and other Catholic prayers to the faithful worldwide.

For those seeking to enrich their daily prayer routine further, we also invite you to listen to our Divine Office podcast, offering the Church’s official prayers throughout the day.

May this time of prayer bring you peace and spiritual renewal.
