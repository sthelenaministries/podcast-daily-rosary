In this episode of the St. Helena Ministries – Daily Rosary, we gather to pray the Glorious Mysteries, reflecting on the resurrection, ascension, and the coming of the Holy Spirit, as well as the crowning of Our Lady. This prayerful meditation invites a deeper contemplation of the triumph of Christ and the hope it brings to all believers. Rooted in the sacred tradition of the Rosary, this episode offers a calm and reverent space to unite in prayer with the Church.

If you find spiritual nourishment in these daily prayers, please consider supporting this ministry to help sustain and share these moments of grace. Your generosity enables us to continue offering peaceful prayer resources for all who seek them.

For those wishing to enrich their daily prayer life further, we invite you to explore our Divine Office podcast, which provides the Church’s Liturgy of the Hours in a gentle and accessible format.

May this time of prayer bring you peace and deepen your communion with Christ and His Blessed Mother.
