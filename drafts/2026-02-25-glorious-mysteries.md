In this episode of St. Helena Ministries – Daily Rosary, join us as we prayerfully meditate on the Glorious Mysteries, inviting the peace and grace of these sacred moments into our hearts. Through calm and reverent reflection, we accompany Our Lady in contemplating the Resurrection, Ascension, the coming of the Holy Spirit, the Assumption, and the Coronation of Mary. This daily prayer offers a gentle rhythm for deepening your connection with Christ and His Mother, grounded in Scripture from the Gospels and Acts.

If this prayer time has been a blessing to you, please consider supporting this ministry so we may continue to provide these moments of spiritual nourishment. Visit our website to learn how you can help.

For those seeking to enrich their daily prayer life further, we also invite you to explore our Divine Office podcast, where the Church’s Liturgy of the Hours is prayed with reverence and care.

May this time of prayer bring you quiet peace and renewed faith.
