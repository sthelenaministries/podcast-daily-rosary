In this episode of the St. Helena Ministries Daily Rosary, we pray the Sorrowful Mysteries, inviting listeners to meditate on the profound moments of Christ’s Passion. Through each mystery, we reflect on the depth of Our Lord’s love and sacrifice, fostering a spirit of quiet contemplation and prayerful union. This prayerful journey offers a moment of peace amid daily life, drawing us closer to the heart of the Gospel as revealed in the Scriptures.

If you find this ministry a source of spiritual nourishment, please consider supporting our work to continue bringing these prayers to the faithful. Your generosity helps sustain this humble offering of prayer and reflection.

For those seeking to deepen their daily prayer life, we also invite you to explore our Divine Office podcast, where the Church’s Liturgy of the Hours is prayed with reverence and care.

May this time of prayer bring you peace and grace throughout your day.
