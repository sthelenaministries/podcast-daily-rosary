In this episode of the St. Helena Ministries – Daily Rosary, we prayerfully meditate on the Joyful Mysteries, inviting you to enter more deeply into the life of Christ and the Blessed Virgin Mary. Through each decade, we reflect on the Annunciation, the Visitation, the Nativity, the Presentation in the Temple, and the Finding in the Temple, drawing from the Gospel accounts found in Luke and Matthew. This quiet time of prayer offers a sacred opportunity to grow in faith and devotion.

If this ministry blesses your daily prayer life, please consider supporting our work by visiting our website. Your generosity helps us continue offering these prayers freely to all who seek them.

For those looking to enrich their prayer routine further, we also invite you to explore our Divine Office podcast, where the Church’s daily prayers are prayed in the rhythm of the liturgical hours.

May this time of prayer bring you peace and grace as you walk with Mary and Jesus today.
