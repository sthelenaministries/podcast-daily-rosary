In this February 14, 2026 episode of St. Helena Ministries – Daily Rosary, we prayerfully meditate on the Joyful Mysteries, inviting you to enter more deeply into the life of Christ through the eyes of His Blessed Mother. Each decade offers a moment to reflect on the Annunciation, Visitation, Nativity, Presentation, and Finding in the Temple, drawing from the Gospel accounts in Luke and Matthew. This sacred time of prayer nurtures a spirit of quiet contemplation and devotion.

If you find spiritual nourishment in these daily prayers, please consider supporting this ministry to help us continue offering these moments of grace freely. Your generosity sustains our mission to bring the Rosary and other devotions to hearts around the world.

For those seeking to enrich their daily prayer life further, we invite you to explore our Divine Office podcast, where the Church’s official prayers unfold throughout the day, deepening your connection to the liturgical rhythm.

May this time of prayer bring you peace and a closer union with Our Lord and His Blessed Mother.
