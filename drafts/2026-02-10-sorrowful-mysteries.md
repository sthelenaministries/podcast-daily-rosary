In this episode of the St. Helena Ministries – Daily Rosary, we prayerfully meditate on the Sorrowful Mysteries, inviting you to enter deeply into the passion of our Lord Jesus Christ. Through each mystery, we reflect on His suffering and love, drawing strength and grace from this sacred devotion. The prayers are offered with reverence, guiding you gently through this time of contemplation and union with Christ’s redemptive sacrifice, as found in the Gospels, particularly in the accounts of His passion.

If this ministry enriches your prayer life, please consider supporting our work so we may continue to provide these daily moments of spiritual nourishment. Your generosity helps sustain our mission to bring the beauty of Catholic prayer to all who seek it.

For those wishing to deepen their daily prayer rhythm, we also invite you to explore our Divine Office podcast, where the Church’s official prayers are prayed throughout the day, fostering a continuous encounter with God.

May this time of prayer bring you peace and a closer walk with our Lord.
