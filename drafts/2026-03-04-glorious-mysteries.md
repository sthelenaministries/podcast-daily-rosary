In this episode of the St. Helena Ministries – Daily Rosary, we gather in prayer to meditate on the Glorious Mysteries, inviting the Holy Spirit to deepen our reflection on the Resurrection, Ascension, and the coming of the Holy Spirit as described in the Gospels and Acts. This sacred time of prayer offers a moment to unite our hearts with Mary and the Church, fostering peace and spiritual renewal. We gently encourage those who find grace in this ministry to consider supporting our ongoing mission to provide daily prayer resources. Your generosity helps us continue to serve the faithful with reverence and care. For those seeking to enrich their daily prayer life further, we invite you to explore our Divine Office podcast, where the Church’s Liturgy of the Hours is prayed throughout the day. Visit our website to learn more and join us in these sacred prayers. May this time of prayer bring you calm and spiritual consolation.
