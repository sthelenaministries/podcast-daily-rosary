In this episode of the St. Helena Ministries Daily Rosary, we prayerfully meditate on the Glorious Mysteries, inviting listeners to enter more deeply into the resurrection and triumph of our Lord as revealed in the Gospel and the Acts of the Apostles. Each decade is prayed with reverence and calm, fostering a spirit of contemplation and devotion rooted in Scripture from the New Testament. We encourage you to join us in this sacred prayer, allowing the mysteries to inspire hope and faith in your daily life. If you find this ministry a source of spiritual nourishment, please consider supporting our work to help us continue offering these prayers freely. For those seeking to enrich their daily prayer rhythm further, we also invite you to explore our Divine Office podcast, where the Church’s liturgical prayers are prayed throughout the day. Visit our website to learn more and to support this ministry. May this time of prayer bring you peace and draw you closer to Christ.
