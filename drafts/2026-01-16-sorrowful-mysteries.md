In this episode of the St. Helena Ministries Daily Rosary, we pray the Sorrowful Mysteries, reflecting on the profound moments of Christ’s passion and sacrifice. Join us in meditative prayer as we contemplate the Agony in the Garden, the Scourging at the Pillar, the Crowning with Thorns, the Carrying of the Cross, and the Crucifixion. This prayerful time invites a deepening of faith and trust in God’s love and mercy. We warmly invite you to support this ministry, helping to sustain these daily prayers and spiritual resources. Your generosity enables us to continue offering these moments of quiet reflection and devotion. For those seeking to enrich their daily prayer life further, we encourage you to explore our Divine Office podcast, which offers the Liturgy of the Hours in a gentle, accessible format.
