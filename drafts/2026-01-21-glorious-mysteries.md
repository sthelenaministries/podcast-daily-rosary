In this episode of St. Helena Ministries – Daily Rosary, we prayerfully meditate on the Glorious Mysteries, inviting you to join in reflecting on the Resurrection, Ascension, and the coming of the Holy Spirit as revealed in Scripture, including passages from the Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles. This sacred time of prayer offers a moment of calm and spiritual nourishment in the midst of your day. We warmly invite you to support this ministry, helping us continue to provide these daily prayers freely to all who seek them. For those wishing to deepen their daily prayer life, consider also listening to our Divine Office podcast, which guides the Church’s official prayer throughout the day. Visit our website to learn more and offer your support. May this time of prayer bring you peace and grace.
