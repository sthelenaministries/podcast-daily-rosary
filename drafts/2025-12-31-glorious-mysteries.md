In this episode of St. Helena Ministries – Daily Rosary, we gather to pray the Glorious Mysteries, reflecting on the Resurrection, Ascension, and the gift of the Holy Spirit, among other profound moments in the life of Christ and Our Lady. This prayer invites a peaceful meditation on the triumph of grace and the hope found in God’s promises, drawing from the scriptural accounts in the Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles. Join us in this calm and reverent time of prayer as we unite our hearts with the Church’s daily devotion.

If this ministry helps nourish your prayer life, please consider supporting our work. Your generosity enables us to continue providing these daily prayers freely to all who seek to deepen their faith.

For those wishing to enrich their daily prayer rhythm further, we also invite you to explore our Divine Office podcast, offering the Church’s official prayers throughout the day.

May this time of prayer bring you peace and spiritual renewal.
