In this episode of St. Helena Ministries – Daily Rosary, we prayerfully meditate on the Glorious Mysteries, inviting you to enter into the joyful contemplation of Christ’s resurrection, ascension, the gift of the Holy Spirit, the Assumption of Mary, and her Coronation as Queen of Heaven. Through this sacred prayer, we join the Church in reflecting on the triumph of life over death and the hope of eternal glory, grounded in the truths revealed in the Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles. This daily offering is a gentle invitation to deepen your communion with Our Lord and Our Lady in a spirit of quiet devotion.
